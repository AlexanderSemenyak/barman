- summary: Fix behavior of the backup shortcuts `last-full` / `latest-full`
  description: |
    The shortcuts `last-full` / `latest-full` were retrieving not the last full backup of
    the server, but the last full backup of the server which was eligible as the parent
    for an incremental backup.

    While this was the expected behavior, the feedback from the community has shown that
    it was confusing for the users.

    From now on, the shortcuts `last-full` / `latest-full` will retrieve the last full
    backup of the Barman server, independently
    if that backup is eligible as the parent for an incremental backup or not.

    The eligibility of the full backup as the parent of an incremental backup will still
    be validated by Barman in a later step, and a proper message will be displayed in
    case it doesn't suit as a parent.
