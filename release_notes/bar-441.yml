- summary: Improve tag handling in cloud commands to fix parsing errors
  description: |
    The `--tags` command-line option in `barman-cloud-backup` and
    `barman-cloud-wal-archive` has been replaced to improve parsing
    reliability and align with standard CLI practices. The previous
    space-separated format could cause parsing errors, especially when
    placed before positional arguments.

    The commands now accept multiple `--tag` flags, one for each key-value pair.

    **Before:**
    `barman-cloud-backup ... --tags key1,val1 key2,val2`

    **After:**
    `barman-cloud-backup ... --tag key1,val1 --tag key2,val2`

    The ``--tags`` option is now deprecated. While existing scripts using the old
    ``--tags`` format will continue to work, users are encouraged to update their
    scripts to the new format. This change is backward compatible and does not introduce
    a breaking change.
