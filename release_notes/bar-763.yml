- summary: Fail gracefully when an unexpected field is found in the backup metadata.
  description: |
    This update improves how Barman handles backup metadata that includes fields unknown
    to the current version. This situation can occur when attempting to restore a backup
    created with a newer version of Barman using an older one. For example, if a newer
    version adds metadata about encryption and the older version doesn't recognize that
    field, that's a case where this change is relevant.

    Previously, this would cause an unhelpful exception. Now, Barman will display a
    clearer message explaining that the backup was created with a newer version and may
    not be compatible with the current version.
