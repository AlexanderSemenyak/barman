- summary: Add option `--if-not-exists` to `barman receive-wal --create-slot`
  description: |
    A new `--if-not-exists` flag has been added to the `barman receive-wal --create-slot`
    command. This prevents the command from failing when attempting to create a
    replication slot that has already been created, making it more reliable for
    use in scripts.
