- summary: Fix WAL archiving performance issues
  description: |
    The Barman WAL archiving process was suffering from a performance degradation due to
    processing of WAL files that would not be archived in the current run. There was also an
    oversight in the encryption logic introduced in 3.14, that caused Barman to check
    for encryption in WAL files streamed to the server, which is unnecessary as streamed
    WALs are never GPG-encrypted, nor compressed. With both issues fixed, the archiving
    process will be significantly faster and more resource-efficient.
