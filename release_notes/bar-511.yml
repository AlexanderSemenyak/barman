- summary: Delete WALs by deleting the entire directory at once, when possible
  description: |
    Previously, when WAL files needed to be deleted (e.g., due to deletion of a backup),
    Barman would iterate over every WAL file and delete them individually. This could
    cause performance issues, mainly in systems which use ZFS filesystem. With this
    change, the entire directory will be deleted whenever noticed that all files in
    the directory are no longer needed by Barman.
