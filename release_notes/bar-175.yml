- summary: Improved S3 connectivity check to support Prefix-Scoped Permissions.
  description: |
    The S3 connectivity test logic has been updated to better support granular IAM
    policies. The test no longer relies on the HeadBucket API call, which requires
    bucket-level s3:ListBucket permissions. Instead, it now performs a check using the
    ListObjectsV2 API call, that is compatible with IAM policies scoped to a specific
    prefix (e.g., s3:prefix conditions). This prevents false-negative connection
    failures for users whose permissions are correctly limited to a specific path within
    a bucket.

    Special thanks to @DimitriosLisenko <dima@cloud66.com> for the PR contribution.
