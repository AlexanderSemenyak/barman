- summary: Validate options passed for servers and models through `config-update`
  description: |
    The `barman config-update` command now performs extra validation on each
    provided section before enqueuing changes. It verifies, among other things,
    that all required fields are present, that the provided values conform to
    the expected types, and that each value also passes its respective parser.
    In addition, the command will now error out if any of the checks fail. This
    prevents partial or malformed updates from being applied.
