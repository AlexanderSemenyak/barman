- summary: Add new xlogdb_directory configuration
  description: |
    Introduces a new `xlogdb_directory` configuration option. This parameter can be
    set either globally or at per-server and allows you to specify a custom directory
    for the `xlog.db` file. This file stores metadata of archived WAL files and is used
    internally by Barman in various scenarios. If unset, it defaults to the value of
    `wals_directory`. Aditionally, the file was also renamed to contain the server name
    as a prefix.
