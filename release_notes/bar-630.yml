- summary: Fix barman restore with --no-get-wal and --standby
  description: |
    Fixed an issue where Barman was removing the `pg_wal` directory during
    recovery if `--no-get-wal` and `--standby-mode` were specified together.
    The issue happened due to Barman incorrectly filling the recovery parameters
    referencing `pg_wal`, including the the `recovery_end_command`, which led to this
    issue. Barman will now ignore filling such parameters as they are not required
    for this specific case.
