- summary: Add current active model to `barman show-server`
  description: |
    Previously, after applying a configuration model, the only way to check
    which model is currently active for a server was via the `barman diagnose`
    command. With this update, the `barman show-server` command now also displays
    the current active configuration model for a server, if any.
