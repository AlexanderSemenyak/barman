- summary: Add `--staging-path` and `--staging-location` to `barman restore`
  description: |
    Added `--staging-path` and `--staging-location` options to `barman restore`
    command to allow the user to specify a custom path for the staging area
    during the restore process. `--staging-path` is the absolute path to be used while
    `--staging-location` defines its location i.e. `local` or `remote`. They also have
    its equivalent configuration options in `barman.conf` as `staging_path` and
    `staging_location` respectively.
