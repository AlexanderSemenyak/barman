- summary: Add client-side compression to `barman-wal-archive`
  description: |
    Client-side compression options have been added to `barman-wal-archive`,
    supporting the same algorithms that are available on a Barman server.
    When enabled, compression is applied on the client side before sending the WAL to
    the Barman server. The `--compression-level` parameter allows specifying a desired
    compression level for the chosen algorithm.
