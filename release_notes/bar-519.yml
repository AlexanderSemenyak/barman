- summary: Ensure correct WAL segment naming for PG17 boundary LSNs
  description: |
    Addresses a backup hang issue experienced with PostgreSQL 17 and later versions when
    using barman backup <server> --wait on low-activity instances and modifies the logic
    within the methods and properties that interact with pg_walfile_name() and
    pg_walfile_name_offset().

    As described in barman#1041, PostgreSQL 17 altered the behavior where the end WAL of
    a backup is now the currently written WAL file, rather than the last completed one.
    On servers with minimal activity, this current WAL file might not be completed or
    archived promptly, leading to the backup process stalling indefinitely until a
    pg_switch_wal() occurs.

    More details on the PostgreSQL change can be found at
    `https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/17.0/`.
