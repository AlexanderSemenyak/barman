- summary: Fixed `barman-cloud-backup` not recycling temporary part files
  description: |
    This fixes a `barman-cloud-backup` problem where temporary part files were not
    deleted after being uploaded to the cloud, leading to disk space problems.
    The issue happened only when using Python >= 3.12 and it was due to a change
    in Python that removed the `delete` attribute of named-temporary file
    objects, which Barman used to rely on when performing internal checks.
