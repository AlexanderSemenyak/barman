- summary: Document procedure to clear WAL archive failure check
  description: |
    While redesigning the Barman docs we missed adding a note advising
    users to run a `switch-wal` command if the server is idle and
    `barman check` returns a failure on "WAL archiving".

    This addresses the gap left from the previous documentation.
