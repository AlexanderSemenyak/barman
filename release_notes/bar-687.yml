- summary: Added support for restoring GPG-encrypted backups.
  description: |
    Barman now supports the decryption and restoration of GPG-encrypted backups using a
    passphrase obtained through the new `encryption_passphrase_command` configuration
    option. During the restore process, decrypted files are staged in a user-defined
    temporary directory specified by the `local_staging_path` setting on the Barman
    host, ensuring a reliable and safe restore process.
