- summary: Support shortcuts as backup IDs in Barman cloud scripts
  description: |
    It is now possible to specify the shortcuts `first`/`oldest`, `last`/`latest` and
    `last-failed` when referencing backups in the Barman cloud commands. Barman now
    automatically parses these shortcuts and returns their associated backup ID.
