- summary: Fixed backup annotations usage in WORM environments
  description: |
    Barman previously stored backup annotation files, used to track operations like
    `barman keep` and `barman delete`, inside the backup directory itself. These
    annotations help determine whether a backup should be kept or marked for deletion.
    However, in WORM environments, files in the backup directory cannot be modified or
    deleted after a certain period, which caused issues with managing backup states.
    This fix relocates annotation files to a dedicated metadata directory, as to
    ensure that such operations function correctly in WORM environments.
