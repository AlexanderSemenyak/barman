- summary: Add `--check-timeout` argument to `barman check` and `barman backup` commands
  description: |
    A new CLI option has been introduced for the `barman check` and `barman backup`
    commands to address situations where the check operation duration exceeds the
    configured `check_timeout`, preventing backups from being scheduled. This option
    allows users to disable the timeout or override the default or configured
    `check_timeout` value.
