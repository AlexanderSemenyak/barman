- summary: Fix regression when running `barman-cloud-backup` as a hook
  description: |
    Barman 3.13.2 changed the location of the `backup.info` metadata file as part
    of the work delivered to fix issues in WORM environments.

    However, those changes introduced a regression when using `barman-cloud-backup`
    as a backup hook in the Barman server: the hook was not aware of the new location
    of the metadata file.

    This update fixes that issue, so `barman-cloud-backup` becomes aware of the new
    folder structure, and properly locates the `backup.info` file, avoiding runtime
    failures.
