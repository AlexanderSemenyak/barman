- summary: Restore without a "backup_id".
  description: |
    Barman is able to restore a backup by providing the backup_id. With this new
    feature, it will be able to restore a backup without providing a "backup_id" as a
    parameter.
    Now the user is able to restore a backup in such ways:
      1. Provide a "backup_id".
      2. Do not provide a "backup_id". It will retrieve the most recent backup.
      3. Do not provide a "backup_id", but provide a recovery target, such as:
        - "target_time" (mutually exclusive with target_lsn)
          Will get the closest backup prior to the "target_time".
        - "target_lsn" (mutually exclusive with "target_time")
          Will get the closest backup prior to the "target_lsn".
        - "target_tli" (can be used alone, or combined with "target_time" or "target_lsn")
          Will get the most recent backup that matches the timeline. If combined with
          other recovery targets, it will get the most recent backup prior to the
          target_time or target_lsn that matches the timeline.

    The recovery targets `--target-xid`, `--target-name` and `--target-immediate`
    are not supported and will error out with a message if used.

    This feature can provide flexibility and ease when restoring a postgres cluster.
