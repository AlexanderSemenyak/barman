- summary: Add new xlogdb_directory configuration
  description: |-
    Introduces a new `xlogdb_directory` configuration option. This parameter can be
    set either globally or per-server, and allows you to specify a custom directory
    for the `xlog.db` file. This file stores metadata of archived WAL files and is used
    internally by Barman in various scenarios. If unset, it defaults to the value of
    `wals_directory`. Additionally, the file was also renamed to contain the server name
    as a prefix.

- summary: Make "backup_id" optional when restoring a backup
  description: |-
    Historically, Barman always required a "backup_id" to restore a backup, and would
    use that backup as the source for the restore.

    This feature removes the need for specifying which backup to use as a source for
    restore, making it optional.

    This change applies to both Barman and the barman-cloud scripts.

    Now the user is able to restore a backup in the following ways:
      1. Provide a "backup_id"
      2. Do not provide a "backup_id". It will retrieve the most recent backup
      3. Do not provide a "backup_id", but provide a recovery target, such as:
        - "target_time" (mutually exclusive with target_lsn)
          Will get the closest backup prior to the "target_time"
        - "target_lsn" (mutually exclusive with "target_time")
          Will get the closest backup prior to the "target_lsn"
        - "target_tli" (can be used combined with "target_time" or "target_lsn")
          Will get the most recent backup that matches the timeline. If combined with
          other recovery targets, it will get the most recent backup prior to the
          target_time or target_lsn that matches the timeline

    The recovery targets `--target-xid`, `--target-name` and `--target-immediate`
    are not supported, and will error out with a message if used.

    This feature will provide flexibility and ease when restoring a postgres cluster.

- summary: Add current active model to `barman show-server` and `barman status`
  description: |-
    Previously, after applying a configuration model, the only way to check
    which model is currently active for a server was via the `barman diagnose`
    command. With this update, the `barman status` and `barman show-server`
    commands now also display the current active configuration model for a
    server, if any.

- summary: Add `--staging-wal-directory` option to `barman restore` command to allow alternative WAL directory on PITR
  description: |-
    A new command line option `--staging-wal-directory` was added to the `restore`/`recover`
    command to allow an alternative destination directory for WAL files when performing
    PITR. Previously, WAL files were copied to a `barman_wal` directory within
    the restore destination directory. This enhancement provides greater flexibility, such as
    storing WALs on separate partitions during recovery.

- summary: Pin boto3 version to any version <= 1.35.99
  description: |-
    Boto3 version 1.36 has changed the way S3 integrity is checked making this version
    incompatible with the current Barman code, generating the following error:

      An error occurred (MissingContentLength) when calling the PutObject operation

    As a temporary workaround, the version for boto3 is pinned to any version <= 1.35.99
    until support for 1.36 is implemented in Barman.

- summary: Make barman-wal-archive smarter when dealing with duplicate WAL files
  description: |-
    Under some corner cases, Postgres could attempt to archive the same WAL twice.
    For example: if `barman-wal-archive` copies the WAL file over to the Barman host,
    but the script is interrupted before reporting success to Postgres. New executions
    of `barman-wal-archive` could fail when trying to archive the same file again
    because the WAL was already copied from Postgres to Barman, but not yet processed by
    the asynchronous Barman WAL archiver.

    This minor change deals with this situation by verifying the checksum of the
    existing and the incoming file. If the checksums match the incoming file is
    ignored, otherwise an output info message is sent and the incoming file is moved to
    the errors directory. The code will exit with 0 in both situations, avoiding WALs
    piling up in the Postgres host due to a failing `archive_command`.

- summary: Document procedure to clear WAL archive failure check
  description: |-
    While redesigning the Barman docs we missed adding a note advising
    users to run a `switch-wal` command if the server is idle and
    `barman check` returns a failure on "WAL archiving".

    This addresses the gap left from the previous documentation.

- summary: Delete WALs by deleting the entire directory at once, when possible
  description: |-
    Previously, when WAL files needed to be deleted (e.g., due to deletion of a backup),
    Barman would iterate over every WAL file and delete them individually. This could
    cause performance issues, mainly in systems which use ZFS filesystem. With this
    change, the entire directory will be deleted whenever noticed that all files in
    the directory are no longer needed by Barman.

- summary: Add support for `DefaultAzureCredential` option on Azure authentication
  description: |-
    Users can now explicitly use Azure's `DefaultAzureCredential` for authentication
    by using the `default` option for `azure_credential` in the server configuration
    or the `--azure-credential default` option in the case of `barman-cloud-*`.
    Previously, that could only be set as a fallback when no credential was provided
    and no environment variables were set.

- summary: Fix PITR when using `barman restore` with `--target-tli`
  description: |-
    Barman was not creating the `recovery.signal` nor filling `recovery_target_timeline`
    in `postgresql.auto.conf` in these cases:

    * The only recovery target passed to `barman restore` was `--target-tli`; or
    * `--target-tli` was specified with some other `--target-*` option, but the
      specified target timeline was the same as the timeline of the chosen backup.

    Now, if any `--target-*` option is passed to `barman restore`, that will be
    correctly treated as PITR.

    An issue was introduced by BAR-242 as part of the Barman 3.12.0 release.
    The issue was causing `barman-cloud-backup-delete` (and possibly other
    commands) to fail with errors like this when `--aws-profile` argument or
    `aws_profile` configuration were not set:

    ```bash

    "redundancy 2 b" for the 'retention_policy' attribute, and "MAIN" is shown instead
    of "simple-wal 2 b" for the 'wal_retention_policy' attribute.
