- summary: Ignore temporary relation files during backups
  description: |
    Files that match the pattern of temporary relation files will now be
    ignored during a `rsync` backup, similar to the exclusion implicitly
    performed by `pg_basebackup`. This is needed to avoid errors when running
    Barman in rsync-concurrent mode against a Postgres instance that creates
    and drops many temporary tables, since rsync might try to copy a temp file
    that had already been removed, causing Barman to hang until manually unblocked.
