- summary: Fix bug when 'profile' variable is referenced before assignment
  description: |
    An issue was introduced by BAR-242 as part of the Barman 3.12.0 release.
    The issue was causing `barman-cloud-backup-delete` (and possibly other
    commands) to fail with errors like this when `--aws-profile` argument or
    `aws_profile` configuration were not set:

    ```bash
    ERROR: Barman cloud backup delete exception: local
    variable 'profile' referenced before assignment`
    ```
