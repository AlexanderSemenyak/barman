- summary: Improve error message when `pg_combinebackup` is not found
  description: |
    Previously, when restoring an incremental backup and `pg_combinebackup` was
    not available in the PATH, Barman did not handle the exception properly, which
    made it difficult to understand and fix the error.
    Now, a proper exception is raised with a clear message indicating that
    `pg_combinebackup` could not found in the target server.
