- summary: Avoid decompressing partial WAL files when custom compression is configured
  description: |
    Fixed an issue where Barman attempted to decompress partial WAL files when
    custom compression was configured. Partial WAL files are never compressed,
    so any attempt to decompress them is incorrect and caused errors when using
    the `--partial` flag with `barman-wal-restore` or `barman get-wal`.
