- summary: Implement GPG WAL encryption
  description: |
    Added GPG encryption to WAL files. This is part of the feature of
    introducing GPG encryption in backups for Barman. This includes
    changing the way that xlogdb is read and written to
    (maintaining backwards compatibility), a new logic
    to detect when files are encrypted and encryption process itself.
