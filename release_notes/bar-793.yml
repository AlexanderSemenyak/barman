- summary: Improve orphan backup warning for proper cleanup
  description: |
    The warning message for orphan backups has been improved to help users fully
    clean up incomplete or manually removed backups. Previously, the message did not
    mention the location of the `backup.info` file, which led to confusion. The updated
    message now clearly indicates the location of the `backup.info` file to help users
    properly remove it.
