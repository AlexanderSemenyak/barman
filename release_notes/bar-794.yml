- summary: Fix errors when deleting orphaned and obsolete backups
  description: |
    Resolved an issue where applying retention policies could fail if a backup
    was both orphaned and obsolete. Barman now verifies that a base backup
    directory exists before attempting to delete it, preventing errors when the
    directory has already been removed.
