- summary: Fix PITR when using `barman restore` with `--target-tli`
  description: |
    Barman was not creating the `recovery.signal` nor filling `recovery_target_timeline`
    in `postgresql.auto.conf` in these cases:

    * The only recovery target passed to `barman restore` was `--target-tli`; or
    * `--target-tli` was specified with some other `--target-*` option, but the
      specified target timeline was the same as the timeline of the chosen backup.

    Now, if any `--target-*` option is passed to `barman restore`, that will be
    correctly treated as PITR.
