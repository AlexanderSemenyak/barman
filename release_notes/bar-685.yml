- summary: Added support for restoring GPG-encrypted WAL files.
  description: |
    Barman now includes full support for decrypting GPG-encrypted WAL files during the
    restore process, using the get-wal and no-get-wal flags of the barman restore
    command. This extends the previously added functionality for decrypting encrypted
    backups via the `encryption_passphrase_command` configuration option.
