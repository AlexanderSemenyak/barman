- summary: Add support for `DefaultAzureCredential` option on Azure authentication
  description: |
    Users can now explicitly use Azure's `DefaultAzureCredential` for authentication
    by using the `default` option for `azure_credential` in the server configuration
    or the `--azure-credential default` option in the case of `barman-cloud-*`.
    Previously, that could only be set as a fallback when no credential was provided
    and no environment variables were set.
