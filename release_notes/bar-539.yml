- summary: Add support for `--azure-credential default` to `barman-cloud-*`
  description: |
    Users can now specify `--azure-credential default` to explicitly use Azure's
    `DefaultAzureCredential` for authentication. Previously, that could only be
    used as a fallback when no credential was provided and no environment
    variables were set.
