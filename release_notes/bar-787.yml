- summary: Fail on restore if the target data or tablespace directories are not empty.
  description: |
    Previously, Barman did not verify whether tablespace destination directories were
    empty before restoring, which could result in their contents being silently
    overwritten â€” potentially causing data loss or corruption. Now, the restore process
    ensures that all destination directories, including those for data and tablespaces,
    are empty before proceeding. If any are not, Barman will halt the operation and
    display an appropriate error message, significantly improving safety and data
    integrity for both local and remote restores.
