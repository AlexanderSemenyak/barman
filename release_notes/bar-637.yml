- summary: Remove pin from version of boto3 used in cloud scripts
  description: |
    After thorough investigation of issues with boto3 >= 1.36, we've
    decided to remove the pin that kept the dependency at version
    1.35.

    Both AWS and MinIO object stores work correctly, and using a version
    of boto3 which is >= 1.36 ensures the Barman cloud scripts work in a FIPS-compliant environment.
