- summary: Pin boto3 version to any version <= 1.35.99
  description: |
    Boto3 version 1.36 has changed the way S3 integrity is checked making this version
    incompatible with the current Barman code, generating the following error:

      An error occurred (MissingContentLength) when calling the PutObject operation

    As a temporary workaround, the version for boto3 is pinned to any version <= 1.35.99
    until support for 1.36 is implemented in Barman.
