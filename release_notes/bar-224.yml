- summary: Add `--staging-wal-directory` option on `restore` command to allow alternative WAL directory on PITR
  description: |
    A new command line option `--staging-wal-directory` was added to the `restore`/`recover`
    command to allow an alternative destination directory for WAL files when performing
    PITR. Previously, WAL files were copied to a `barman_wal` directory within
    the restore destination directory. This enhancement provides greater flexibility, such as
    storing WALs on separate partitions during recovery.
