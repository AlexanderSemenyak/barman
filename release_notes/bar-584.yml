- summary: Fix Barman not honoring `custom_decompression_filter`
  description: |
    Fixed an issue where Barman was not honoring the configured
    `custom_decompression_filter` if the compression algorithm specified
    was natively supported by Barman. Custom filters now take priority
    over native handlers when decompressing WAL files.
